Chapter 10 Estimation
What is estimate?
 - For business, it is a commitment, which is about certainty.
 - But estimate is a guess. 
    - No commitment is implied. No promise is made. 
    - It is not a number. It is a distribution.
    - Professionals draw a clear distinction between estimates and commitments.
        - No implied commitments. E.g., 
        - Can we say four then? No, it could be five or six.
        - Can you try to make it no more than six days? (try means success, means work more than eight hours, work on weekends, skip family vacations)

Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)
- Minimal (<1% chance it would happen)
- Normal (most likely estimate)
- Maximal (<1% chance it would happen)


Estimate Tasks with wideband delphi
- Goal: reach the consensus among a team
- Warning: meeting, documents, ceremony overhead

The Law of Large Numbers
- Goal: reduce error by break down large task into smaller tasks
- Warning: integration is hardly perfect
